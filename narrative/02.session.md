# SESSION 2: THE TEMPLE

_22 Ambyrmont 969 AC_

The Temple offered shelter from the storm, but what our heroes found within its ancient walls would transform their desperate flight into a race against divine retribution itself.

Elowyn's elven eyes pierced the darkness of the antechamber, revealing walls that told a story of desecration - once-beautiful frescoes hacked to pieces by orcish axes, sacred spaces defiled by crude violence. Yet even in ruin, the temple retained an aura of sanctity that promised respite from the killing cold outside.

In the main sanctum, beneath a cathedral ceiling that had weathered decades of neglect, old Keestake immediately set about building a fire. "The ceiling's high enough," he muttered through his wild beard, "and those windows up there will draw the smoke." As warmth began to seep back into frozen limbs, the party's attention was drawn to the raised dais beyond tattered curtains.

There stood the goddess - or what remained of her. The marble statue had been systematically brutalized, her face smashed, her form smeared with filth in an act of deliberate sacrilege. Yet Elowyn and Alice saw past the defilement to the essential beauty beneath. With reverent hands, they began cleaning away the grime, an act of respect that would prove more significant than they could imagine.

While some tended to the statue, others explored the temple's wings. The old priests' quarters yielded unexpected treasures - cloth and supplies enough to fashion proper clothing and torches. The kitchen still held serviceable cookware, though the storerooms told grimmer tales: one filled with rotted grain, another hung with meat hooks still bearing ancient brown stains.

Keestake's idea of "hunting" proved to be rat-catching in the temple's record room, but after two weeks of slave gruel, even roasted rat seemed a feast. As the party finally introduced themselves properly - including their fellow survivors Melisande (a merchant's daughter promising reward) and Althus (a wandering laborer) - they began to feel, perhaps for the first time since the shipwreck, a fragile sense of hope.

That hope would be both validated and shattered when night fell.

During Elowyn's watch, golden light emanated from the cleaned statue. The goddess herself manifested - Ma'at, she named herself - and her words chilled the blood more than any storm:

"The Hak-Kubra defiled my sanctuary. For this, the island dies."

The goddess had intended to scour the island clean this very night, but the presence of innocents stayed her hand - barely. Twenty-four hours. That's all the mercy divinity would grant. By midnight tomorrow, they must be gone, or perish with every orc, goblin, and living thing on this accursed isle.

Yet Ma'at was not without compassion. She blessed the party, granting them the ability to use any magical artifacts remaining on the island, and promised her protection from the storm's fury if they could find a way to escape. When pressed by the newly awakened party, Keestake reluctantly revealed a possibility: Princess Ahradel, the Sea-King's daughter, had been buried with grave goods including a boat. If it still survived in the catacombs beneath the manor...

But between them and salvation lay a battlefield. Cato and Aurae climbed to the temple's upper floors to scout the situation: orc pirates held the barracks, goblin seafarers controlled the stables, and the manor between them had become a chaotic neutral zone where both sides clashed for supremacy through stealth and treachery instead of open warfare.

Their reconnaissance was violently interrupted when a ghoul - ancient, mad, and hungry - burst from the shadows. Its gibbering shrieks echoed through the temple as it savaged Aurae with yellowed claws. The party rushed to their aid, and in a desperate battle of torches, stones, and steel, they brought the creature down. But the encounter served as a grim reminder: even their sanctuary held deadly secrets.

As the session closed, Elowyn received a final blessing from Ma'at - divine healing that mended her wounds in moments rather than days. It was a sign of the goddess's favor, but also a reminder of the clock ticking toward their doom.
Twenty-four hours to breach a battlefield, descend into haunted catacombs, and escape an island marked for divine annihilation.

The real adventure had just begun.

_Next Session: With time running out, our heroes must navigate the war between orc and goblin forces to reach the manor and the catacombs below. Will the Sea-King's daughter's grave goods provide salvation, or will they discover that some tombs are better left sealed?_

# SESSION 4: THE SHADE AND THE SEA-KING’S DAUGHTER

_23 Ambyrmont 969 AC_

The catacombs did not grow kinder as the party pressed deeper. With Keestake’s confession still echoing in their minds and tons of stone sealing their only known way out, the choice before them boiled down to a single, brutal truth: forward, or die in the dark.

The first chambers they found looked promising at a glance—storerooms, by the look of them, packed once upon a time with crates and supplies. Time and damp had done their work. Elowyn slipped into one room, crossbow at the ready, only to find a graveyard of rotted wood and mildew. Crates collapsed at a touch, their contents long since turned to mush or mold. If these had ever held food or gear, that hope had died decades ago.

Nearby, Aurae investigated a second store-room that seemed, at first, more hopeful. Here, the crates were intact and stacked in teetering towers up to the ceiling. Prying one open revealed not food or weapons, but packed earth and rocks—ballast, or perhaps some kind of crude reinforcement. As she moved between the stacks, the quiet of the catacombs broke into hissing and scrabbling. A nest of rats, thin and desperate, boiled out from between the crates and swarmed her.

The fight was short but ugly. Blades and boots and thrown weapons met yellow teeth and filthy claws as the party piled in to help. By the time the last rat lay twitching, the ones in the front line bore fresh bites and scratches for their trouble. There was no treasure here, only the reminder that in these depths, even the vermin were hungry enough to fight to the death.

Deeper in, the air grew colder and wetter. They came to a chamber dominated by a stone well, its lip slick with moisture. When they leaned over, torchlight revealed nothing but a yawning drop into darkness and the distant roar of water far below—an underground river, raging unseen through the bones of the island. The stones around the well sweated condensation, and the floor nearby had a disturbing give to it, as if something beneath had turned to mud. Each step produced a faint, spongy squelch.

It was with that unease underfoot that they reached the corridor Keestake’s map had so helpfully labeled the “go-slow hallway.” The name did not inspire confidence. Moisture stained the stones here as well, dark patches spreading across the floor. Remembering the false floors and collapsing ceilings they’d already survived, nobody was eager to test this stretch the conventional way.

So they opted for something less conventional.

Gaia, lightest of the group, volunteered—more or less—to be the guinea pig. With a few muttered apologies, Elowyn and Rogal hefted her and tossed her bodily beyond the suspiciously damp tiles. She hit the stone hard, skidding a few feet—and felt the floor flex alarmingly under her weight, the stone sagging like old bread. She relayed this back in a strained voice that did not exactly inspire confidence in the plan.

Undeterred (or perhaps just out of better ideas), they tried again with Rogal. This time the toss went off. He crashed down nearer to the treacherous section, and the floor made its opinion known. With a teeth-rattling crack, the stone gave way beneath him. Rogal plummeted into darkness, landing twenty feet below on a narrow ledge of slick mud and shattered rock, bruised but mercifully alive.

It took the better part of an hour, a great deal of swearing, and most of their salvaged cloth and leather to solve that mistake. Working by dim torchlight, the party braided strips of torn garments, old belts, and scavenged straps into a makeshift rope that looked like it might come apart if breathed on too hard. They moved to cross the collapsed area, finding - luckily - that while the center of the hall had fallen away into a muddy shaft, there remained about two feet of solid stone ledge hugging each wall. Carefully, inch by inch, they edged along these narrow margins and crossed the gap, leaving the false floor and its hungry drop behind. 

Now safe, for the moment, they lowered the makeshift rope down to Rogal, who wrapped it around himself and held on for dear life as the group hauled. The line creaked and stretched and threads snapped audibly, but it held. With a final heave, they dragged Rogal up and over the broken edge, all of them collapsing in a heap of sweat and nervous laughter. 

Beyond the treacherous hallway, the passage opened into a junction. To the east, another corridor stretched away, lined with doors set into the southern wall. To the south, the stone dipped into deeper shadow and a breath of air carried with it a chill that had nothing to do with ordinary cold.

They chose east first.

Alice took point, easing open the first door with caution this time, and her caution paid off. As the door swung outward, a cable snapped taut, yanking the trigger of an ancient arbalest propped atop a chair inside the tiny chamber. The weapon went off with a deafening *thunk*, the bolt streaking past Alice close enough to ruffle her hair before shattering against the far wall in a spray of splinters.

Inside, the setup was as pathetic as it was deadly: a lonely bed frame, a rotted mattress, a bureau whose drawers had long since fallen apart—and the jury-rigged ancient arbalest, now spent. Door after door revealed much the same: cramped cells with ruined beds, empty bureaus, and the desiccated remains of a once-orderly refuge. This was where the manor’s residents had intended to flee when the siege had come, but apparently they had never had the chance to do so. Whatever comfort these rooms once offered had been drained away, leaving only dust and disappointment.

The southern corridor offered no such illusions. The air grew colder with every step, a biting chill that seeped through clothing and into bone. The torchlight seemed to dim of its own accord as they entered a desecrated chapel hollowed out of the rock.

Broken pews lay scattered like bones across the floor. Ritual implements—chalices, censers, shards of stained glass—were strewn about in chaotic piles. At the far end, a splintered altar crouched before a statue of the Goddess, her marble form decapitated, her sanctity defiled. Before that ruined altar sat something that did not belong at all: a coffin, set hastily and without ceremony, as though someone had dragged it here and abandoned it in a hurry.

The coffin was wrong. A counter-clockwise spiral had been carved into its lid, grooves stained with a gritty purple dye that caught the light in a way their torches didn’t like. It felt less like a burial mark and more like a brand, or a lock.

As Elowyn stepped closer to inspect it, the shadows shifted. The party’s torchlight seemed to stretch and twist, and from behind the headless statue a figure peeled itself out of the darkness—a translucent shade, taking the form of a once-beautiful woman now warped by centuries of hatred. Her eyes burned with a cold, purple light, and her voice dripped venom as she glided forward.

“I will not let you do this,” she hissed, her gaze locked on Elowyn as if she saw someone else entirely.

At the same time, a heavy pounding began from inside the coffin. Wood rattled. A muffled voice shouted, the words indistinct beneath lid and sigil, but undeniably furious and very much *not* dead.

Rogal acted first, charging the coffin. With a grunt, he shoved the lid aside. What lay within had once been a girl in her late teens, dressed in finery now stained and moldering. Her skin was pale as death, her body very clearly a corpse…  right up until she sat up, eyes snapping open, and glared past Rogal at the hovering shade.

“You *bitch*,” she snarled, scrambling out of the coffin. “What did you do to me?”

The shade ignored her entirely, focusing instead on the living intruders. Darkness coiled around her hands as she lunged at Elowyn, and the chapel exploded into motion.

The battle that followed was as much a test of nerve as of steel. Mundane weapons bit into the shade’s form as if through smoke, each strike shredding a little more of its ghostly substance. The air filled with the smell of cold stone and old grave-dirt. The girl—Ahradel, as they would later learn—threw herself at the shade with reckless fury, clawing and striking, more a manifestation of rage than a proper ally, though the creature seemed oddly elusive, never quite succumbing to the girl's grasp.

Little by little, the party wore the shade down, with each member of the party striking out as best they could with the weapons they'd collected in their time on the island - missiles and blades passing through the shade's form, warping as though through leaded glass, but each connection seeming to weaken the creature's substance. At last, Alice loosed a single, perfect shot that struck where its heart should have been. The shade convulsed, let out a sound that was more a howl of thwarted obsession than pain, and then unraveled, its form dissolving into tatters of shadow that faded into the gloom.

With the shade gone, the chapel exhaled. The crushing pressure lifted, the torches burned brighter, and for the first time they could hear the faint, comforting crackle of their own flames.

Then the statue moved.

Stone limbs that had been still for decades shivered and straightened. The goddess’s marble form shone with inner light as Ma’at’s presence filled the ruined chapel. She took in the shattered altar, the defiled coffin, and the spiral sigil with something like horror. Her voice reverberated through the stone.

“Destroy that mark,” she commanded, indicating the spiral on the coffin. “It must not remain.”

Elowyn obliged without argument, and the spiral was struck violently from the coffin's lid, scattering purple-stained wooden fragments across the floor. As the last trace of the sigil vanished, a weight seemed to lift from the room. Ma’at’s dismay softened into something warmer.

For their defiance, their mercy, and their stubborn refusal to bow to the island’s corruption, she offered them a boon. Each hero felt a surge of power deep within, as if their struggles had crystallized into newfound strength. Muscles seemed surer, reflexes sharper, wills harder. Whatever came next, they would face it as something more than the desperate slaves who had washed ashore.

Only then did they properly speak with the coffin-girl.

She named herself Ahradel—Princess Ahradel, daughter of Viledel the Sea-King. The shade they had destroyed had been her mother, and she spat the title “mother” like a curse. By her account, the older woman had been responsible for whatever strange, half-living condition Ahradel now suffered, trapping her somewhere between death and undeath.

When the party asked about escape from the island, the princess fell silent for a long moment, struggling to piece together her own fragmented memories. Slowly, painfully, she realized what must have happened: her coffin had been torn from her true resting place and dragged here, into this stolen chapel, to serve some darker purpose. Her *real* tomb—her intended, honored resting place—must still lie hidden elsewhere in the catacombs.

And if she was buried properly, she reasoned, then her grave goods would be there as well. Including the boat her father would have ordered entombed with her.

It might be battered, it might be buried, it might be nearly as cursed as the rest of this place—but it was a boat, and in a world where the goddess herself had decreed the island’s doom by dawn, a boat was salvation.

Ahradel straightened, accepting Cato's advice to stay focused on the simple things for now. She offered to guide them to her true tomb, to the boat, and to whatever slim chance of escape remained.

In the flickering light of the ruined chapel, with a dead princess as their guide and a goddess’s blessing burning in their veins, the party chose their next path: deeper still, into the Sea-King’s underworld kingdom, chasing a ghost’s promise of freedom.

*Next Session: Our heroes delve deeper into the royal crypts in search of the princess’s rightful tomb and the boat buried with her. But the Sea-King’s will—and Keestake’s twisted wish—still linger in these depths. What other dire things still waited between them and their only hope of escape?*

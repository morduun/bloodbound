# SESSION 1: THE ISLE AND THE STORM
_22 Ambyrmont 969 AC_

The session opened with catastrophe as the slave galley *Bloodbound* met its doom against the rocky shores of a forgotten island. The storm that claimed the ship was no ordinary tempest - this was nature's fury incarnate, with winds that could tear a person from the deck and rain that struck like frozen needles.

Our unlikely heroes emerged from the wreckage: six souls who had been bound for the slave markets of Minrothad, now suddenly free but facing a more immediate threat - death by exposure. The temperature plummeted as they surveyed their grim situation: a ship torn asunder, its bow completely severed, and nowhere to shelter from the apocalyptic weather.

But first, they had to deal with Hafkir, the brutish half-orc second mate who had survived the wreck. In a desperate melee on the wind-swept beach, brave Elowyn charged the slaver head-on while her companions provided support. Though bloodied in the exchange, the group's teamwork prevailed, and they claimed the half-orc's gear - including a mysterious key.

That key led them back to the ship's partially intact cabin, where they discovered treasures that would prove invaluable: weapons, a spellbook of unknown power, and nautical charts revealing secrets of the Minrothad black markets. But with the temperature dropping dangerously, they couldn't linger.

Following the sounds of battle inland, the party discovered a shocking scene: orcs and goblins locked in vicious combat over... something. Behind the orcish line lay an ancient prisoner - a wild-eyed old man with a beard like Spanish moss and clothes that might have been fine silk sixty years ago.

In a daring rescue that would have made any rogue proud, Alice and Elowyn rappelled down into the ravine while the monsters were distracted by their bloodletting. They freed the old man and escaped just as the tide of battle shifted.

The old man's story was as mysterious as the island itself. He claimed to have been valet to "the King" of this isle, back when his hair was black and his face unlined. He spoke of a manor now contested by the warring monster factions, of barracks held by orcs and stables claimed by goblins. But the Temple - ah, the Temple should still be safe.

As the first session ended, our heroes followed this enigmatic guide through the storm toward the promise of sanctuary, each step taking them deeper into the mysteries of this lost island. What king once ruled here? Why do orcs and goblins fight over its ruins? And what other secrets lie waiting in the Temple's sacred halls?

The storm rages on, but our zeros have taken their first steps toward becoming heroes...

*Next Session: The Temple of the Unknown Goddess awaits, but will it truly offer sanctuary, or does something divine - or perhaps profane - still dwell within its ancient walls?*

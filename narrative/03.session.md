# SESSION 3: THE MANOR, THE CATACOMBS, AND THE COLLAPSE

The goddess had given them twenty-four hours. Now, with rain lashing the temple walls and two armies locked in bloody conflict outside, our heroes faced an impossible gauntlet between them and salvation.

The plan seemed simple enough: cross 160 feet of open ground between the temple and the manor's secret entrance. But simplicity died quickly when faced with reality - orc raiders held the barracks, goblin pirates controlled the stables, and both sides were using the manor as their killing field. Through sheets of rain and darkness, patrols crossed and recrossed the muddy expanse, their torches guttering in the storm.

"Red light," Elowyn whispered, her darkvision tracking the patrols. "Green light." The party crept forward in desperate bursts, using the storm as cover, praying the thunder would mask any sounds they made. Every step was agony, every heartbeat a drum that surely the enemy must hear. When they finally reached the manor wall, all of them were soaked, shaking, and grateful to still be breathing.

Keestake led them to his secret entrance - iron bars bent just enough over the years for his withered frame to slip through. One by one they squeezed into the servants' quarters, only to find the old man's carefully maintained room utterly destroyed. His anguish nearly gave them away before Elowyn could calm him with gentle words and a firm hand.

Then came the gauntlet through the manor proper. Following Keestake's lead toward the scribes' chambers and the hidden entrance to the catacombs, they could hear the war raging in earnest. The party dove into separate rooms as goblin and orc forces clashed in the hallways, turning the ornate corridors into an abattoir.

In the library, Elowyn and Alice found themselves trapped with four goblin pirates who were fighting over a red lacquered wand. When the argument turned lethal - the wand firing magic missiles that killed one goblin instantly - the survivors spotted our heroes. A desperate melee ensued, with Alice taking grievous wounds before they managed to cut down their attackers and claim the wand along with several scimitars.

Meanwhile, Cato and the others cowered in an art gallery, watching through the cracked door as the battle raged past. Bodies piled up. Blood pooled on marble floors. The storm outside seemed gentle compared to the slaughter within.

When the fighting finally moved on, leaving six dead goblins in its wake, the party regrouped and pressed forward. The scriptorium held their goal - a bookcase that hadn't moved in decades, its secret mechanism hidden behind moldering tomes. But when Cato tried to activate it, the ancient mechanism shrieked like a banshee, metal grinding on metal, surely alerting every orc and goblin in the manor.

Frantically they barricaded the door with furniture while Cato wrestled the secret entrance open through brute force. Down they went, sixty feet on iron rungs into absolute darkness, with the sounds of pursuit growing closer above.

And then Keestake pulled the lever.

The ceiling collapsed with a roar of stone and timber, sealing the entrance completely. As dust settled in the torchlight, the old man began to speak, and with each word, the party's hearts sank deeper into despair.

There was no boat. There had never been a boat.

Keestake had served the Sea-King - "Him," he called his master - for longer than memory. When the kingdom fell, when the royal family died, Keestake had been the one to bury them properly in these very catacombs. The king's magical ring, the one that could grant wishes, still rested on the corpse's finger. And Keestake had wished for one thing: that the bodies would remain beautiful and unchanged until the end of days.

"His eyes follow me still," the old man whispered, lost now in ancient grief. "After all these years."

He had led them here not for escape, but for his own protection. The stones above would keep the orcs and goblins from ever finding him again. He would die here, with his beloved master, as he'd always intended.

As for our heroes? "You'll be comfortable enough," he said with the casual cruelty of the mad. "You'll be here a little while."

Forever, he meant.

The party stood in shocked silence in the catacombs' entrance chamber, their only light the flickering torch in Keestake's trembling hand. Before them stretched corridors of darkness, trapped and treacherous if his map was true. Behind them, tons of rubble and an old man who had chosen his tomb.

But they had come too far to surrender to despair. Leaving Keestake to his madness, they began their exploration of the crypts. Alice, despite her wounds, took point, triggering trap after trap - false floors, falling ceilings, rooms filled with worthless crates meant to crush the unwary. Each chamber seemed designed not just to kill, but to mock, filled with rotted supplies and fool's gold promises of treasure.

Yet they pressed on, because somewhere in this tomb lay a king's corpse wearing a wishing ring, and with less than twenty hours remaining, that impossible magic might be their only hope.

_Next Session: Next Session: The party must navigate the trapped catacombs, find the Sea-King's tomb, and somehow claim a ring that can grant wishes - if Keestake's mad ramblings can be believed. But what price will such magic demand, and what horror has the old servant's wish truly created in these depths?

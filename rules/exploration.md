# EXPLORATION

## Behind Enemy Lines

As players traverse areas that are dangerous, they have a chance of being noted by their denizens. The DC of avoiding encounters in dangerous territories is depending on the type of terrain the party's traveling through, the menaces present in that terrain, the method the party is using to avoid encounters, and the characters leading the group.

### Avoidance Skills & Terrain
Characters have a number of skills they can use to potentially avoid encounters - their application across terrain types, as a general guide, is provided below.

| Terrain Type | Arcana | History | Insight | Investigation | Nature | Perception | Stealth | Survival |
|:------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:------:|:----------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Natural      |    -   |    -    |    -    |       -       |   10   |     15     |   10    |    10    |
| Urban        |    -   |   20    |   15    |      15       |    -   |     15     |   10    |    -     |
| Magical      |    10  |    -    |    -    |       -       |    -   |     20     |   15    |    -     |
| Ruins        |    -   |   15    |    -    |      15       |    -   |     15     |   10    |    -     |
| Underdark    |    15  |    -    |   20    |       -       |   20   |     15     |   10    |    15    |

### Skill uses
- **Arcana**: Comprehension of magical terrain, such as blights, elemental incursions, or otherworldly terrain
- **History**: Knowledge of the locations and layouts of ruins, battlefields, or even modern cities.
- **Insight**: Understanding how people will move in an urban environment.
- **Investigation**: Examining one's surroundings to predict ambushes, traps and so forth.
- **Nature**: Discerning how the terrain can provide cover for both the party and their enemies.
- **Perception**: General ability to notice funny stuff right before it happens.
- **Stealth**: Understanding how to conceal oneself from enemies in any situation.
- **Survival**: Being able to note signs of others in the area and predict where they might be

### Danger Level
Danger levels serve one purpose: to represent how well-patrolled or well-observed an area is by increasing the difficulty of remaining unnoticed while moving through that area. In general it's safe to denote danger in four levels:

| Danger | DC | Description |
|:------------:|:--:|:------------|
| 0 | -5 | Unguarded, uninhabited.|
| 1 |  0 | Sparsely inhabited, disorganized presence |
| 2 | +5 | Lightly patrolled, pickets and scouts |
| 3 | +10 | Regularly patrolled, checkpoints and posts |
| 4 | +15 | Heavily patrolled, high alert |

### Resolving detection
Roll once per travel leg, at the same time as the Navigation roll is made -- that is, once before noon, and once before arriving at the day's destination. On a success, any unpleasant encounters or surprises are avoided. On a failure, consequences are in the DM's hands.

On a failure, at the DM's discretion, an encounter should take place, though a combat encounter isn't always called for. The fact that the party was detected, however, will preclude any way for them to evade the encounter.

> Note that Weather modifiers can work in the party's favor for purposes of avoiding discovery (-5 DC with rain, snow, or mist, and -10 DC for major storms)

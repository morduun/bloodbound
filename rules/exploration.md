# EXPLORATION

## Behind Enemy Lines

As players traverse areas that are dangerous, they have a chance of being noted by their denizens. The DC of avoiding encounters in dangerous territories is depending on the type of terrain the party's traveling through, the menaces present in that terrain, the method the party is using to avoid encounters, and the characters leading the group.

### Avoidance Skills & Terrain
Characters have a number of skills they can use to potentially avoid encounters - their application across terrain types, as a general guide, is provided below.

| Terrain Type | Arcana | History | Insight | Investigation | Nature | Perception | Stealth | Survival |
|:------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:------:|:----------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Natural      |    -   |    -    |    -    |       -       |   10   |     15     |   10    |    10    |
| Urban        |    -   |   20    |   15    |      15       |    -   |     15     |   10    |    -     |
| Magical      |    10  |    -    |    -    |       -       |    -   |     20     |   15    |    -     |
| Ruins        |    -   |   15    |    -    |      15       |    -   |     15     |   10    |    -     |
| Underdark    |    15  |    -    |   20    |       -       |   20   |     15     |   10    |    15    |

### Skill uses
- **Arcana**: Comprehension of magical terrain, such as blights, elemental incursions, or otherworldly terrain
- **History**: Knowledge of the locations and layouts of ruins, battlefields, or even modern cities.
- **Insight**: Understanding how people will move in an urban environment.
- **Investigation**: Examining one's surroundings to predict ambushes, traps and so forth.
- **Nature**: Discerning how the terrain can provide cover for both the party and their enemies.
- **Perception**: General ability to notice funny stuff right before it happens.
- **Stealth**: Understanding how to conceal oneself from enemies in any situation.
- **Survival**: Being able to note signs of others in the area and predict where they might be

### Observation Level

Danger levels serve one purpose: to represent how well-patrolled or well-observed an area is by increasing the difficulty of remaining unnoticed while moving through that area. In general it's safe to denote danger in three levels:

| DC  | Description |
|:---:|:------------|
|  +5 | Lightly patrolled, pickets and scouts |
| +10 | Regularly patrolled, checkpoints and posts |
| +15 | Heavily guarded, sensitive area |

### Alert Level

The alert level of a region represents how aware and focused the area's patrols are of potential dangers. 

|  DC  | Description                                                  |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  -5  | Distraction - a loud commotion, a fire somewhere sensitive, etc. |
|  +5  | Recent suspicious activity detected - tracks or clues of intrusion but no evidence |
| +10  | Danger detected - hard evidence of intrusion, alarm bells rung, etc. |

### Obstacle Density

Danger levels can be modified by an area which has a lot of cover - a dense urban sprawl, a forest with considerable undergrowth and so on.

|  DC  | Description                                                  |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  -5  | Moderate cover available (sparse ruins or trees, village buildings) |
| -10  | Significant cover available (thick trees or underbrush, densely packed structures) |

### Environmental Effects

Finally, environmental effects like weather, or other similar effects (smoke from a fire) can make it harder to detect a potential invader.

|  DC  | Description                               |
| :--: | ----------------------------------------- |
|  -5  | Rain, snow, or light mist or smoke        |
| -10  | Major storm, blanketing mist, heavy smoke |



### Resolving detection

Roll once per travel leg, at the same time as the Navigation roll is made -- that is, once before noon, and once before arriving at the day's destination. On a success, any unpleasant encounters or surprises are avoided. On a failure, consequences are in the DM's hands.

On a failure, at the DM's discretion, an encounter should take place, though a combat encounter isn't always called for. The fact that the party was detected, however, will preclude any way for them to evade the encounter.

## Missile Weapons

### Crossbows
- When the character is [Prone], firing a crossbow is **not** at disadvantage.
- However, a crossbow cannot be _loaded_ while the character is [Prone].

#### Heavy Crossbows
- Fires once every other round. Assume it's preloaded on Round 1.
	- The [Crossbow Expert] feat removes this restriction.

# Optional Rule: The Mortal Coil

This system replaces the standard rules for Death Saving Throws to introduce grit, long-term consequences, and heroic sacrifice. It redefines Hit Points as "Stamina" or "Luck"—a protective buffer that, once depleted, forces a character to trade their life force to stay in the fight.

### Fate Points

Every character has **3 Fate Points**. These are tracked using the **Death Saving Throw** failures on the character sheet.

- **Unspent Fate Points** represent a character's reserve of luck and resilience.
- **Spent Fate Points** represent deep trauma, exhaustion, and the encroachment of death.

### Spending Fate

A character may choose to spend a Fate Point as a **Reaction** to specific triggers. When a point is spent, mark off one Death Saving Throw failure. This mark remains until recovered (see *Recovery*).

You may spend Fate in two ways:

#### 1. Defy Death (Physical)

Trigger: You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.

Effect: You spend 1 Fate Point. You take no damage from the triggering attack. Instead, you immediately suffer a Physical Scar (see Scars of Conflict).

#### 2. Grim Resolve (Mental)

Trigger: You fail a Saving Throw.

Effect: You spend 1 Fate Point. You treat the failed save as if you had rolled a Natural 20. You immediately suffer a Mental Scar (see Scars of Conflict).

------

### Scars of Conflict

When you spend a Fate Point, the severity of the consequence depends on how deeply you have drawn from the well. Roll on the table corresponding to the **total number of Fate Points currently spent** (including the one just used).

#### Tier 1: The Warning (1st Point Spent)

These injuries are painful and distracting, but not debilitating.

Recovery: These Scars heal after a Long Rest, provided someone succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check to tend to them.

### Recovery & Death

#### Recovering Fate Points

Your Fate Points (the slots themselves) represent your adrenaline and will to live.

- **Long Rest:** All spent Fate Points are un-marked and become available for use again.
- *Note:* Recovering the Point **does not** heal the Scar. You may wake up with full Fate Points (ready to fight), but still suffer from a *Shattered Limb* (Tier 3 Scar) acquired yesterday.

#### Dying

When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and choose **not** to spend a Fate Point (or have none left), you fall Unconscious and make Death Saving Throws as normal, with the following changes:

- **Spent Points are Failures:** Any Fate Points currently spent count as automatic failures that cannot be rolled for.
  - *If you have spent 1 Point:* You die on **2** failures.
  - *If you have spent 2 Points:* You die on **1** failure.
  - *If you have spent 3 Points:* If you drop to 0 Hit Points, you **die instantly**.

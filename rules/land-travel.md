## Travel Abilities

### Blaze Trail
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Exhausting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Strength (Athletics)

Cut a path through thick undergrowth or create hand- and footholds.

> Traveling through difficult terrain slows your journey significantly. You can help your companions by clearing a path for them to follow.

Make a Strength (Athletics) check against the Navigation DC. 
- If you **succeed**, the terrain's travel speed penalty is reduced by 1 mile per hour (to a minimum of 0).
- If you **succeed by 5 or more**, the terrain's travel speed penalty is reduced by 2 miles per hour instead.
- If you **fail the check by less than 5**, you still reduce the terrain's travel speed penalty by 1 mile per hour (to a minimum of 0), but you automatically suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the activity.

### Cartography

___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Intelligence (Cartographers' Tools)

___
Record your travel route and mark notable landmarks for future reference and orientation. Drawing a map won't help you on your journey forward, but may be invaluable in finding your way back.


> Make a Cartographers' Tools check against the DC of your terrain type +10, then consult this table and take note of the value of your efforts:

| Map Quality | Easy DC | Mod. DC | Hard DC | Value |
| :---------: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :---: |
|  Detailed   |   15    |   20    |   25    |   3   |
|   Simple    |   10    |   15    |   20    |   2   |
|    Crude    |    5    |   10    |   15    |   1   |
|   Failed    |    —    |    —    |    —    |   0   |

When you've reached your destination, add the values of all checks together and divide by the legs of travel to get the final quality of your map.  Note that if your Navigator fails their check by 5 or more, the fact that they've led you in the wrong direction will result in a 0 value map for this leg of the journey.



### Hunt & Forage

___
- **Qualities:** _Dangerous_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Survival)

___
As you travel, you watch for nearby sources of food and water - roots, fruits, small game, hidden springs and so forth.


> Make a Survival check and compare the results with the region's abundance level on the following table to determine the number of fresh rations you manage to provide. Each ration can sustain one person for one day (ie, a pound of food and a gallon of water):

| Abundance |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7   |  8   |
| :-------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  Plenty   |  10  |  12  |  14  |  16  |  18  |  20  |  22  |  24  |
|  Average  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  19  |  22  |  25  |  28  |  —   |
|  Scarce   |  15  |  19  |  23  |  27  |  31  |  35  |  —   |  —   |
|  Barren   |  20  |  25  |  30  |  35  |  40  |  —   |  —   |  —   |


### Keep Watch
___
- **Qualities:** _none_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Perception)

Detect hidden pursuers and prevent being surprised by an encounter.

> Make a Wisdom (Perception) check - if your passive Perception is higher, use that score instead. The DM decides the DC of detecting any threats along the way.

If you're traveling at a ***Fast Pace***, all passive Perception scores suffer a -5.

### Navigate
____
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Intelligence (Navigator's Tools) 

Find your way to a specific location.

> Make your check against the Navigation DC each leg you travel. The navigation DC is additionally modified by any information you possess to reach your destination, as well as the weather. Modifiers are presented in tables on the first page.

### Scout
___
- **Qualities:** _Dangerous, Exhausting_
- **Skill Use:** Intelligence (Investigation)

Scout ahead to find new paths, nearby dangers, and points of interest.

> Make your check - the DM determines DC for discoverable elements in the area. On a good enough roll, you may find creatures waiting in ambush, favorable paths, or hidden locations. On a particularly poor roll, they may instead find you.

If your check beats the Navigation DC, you can give one of your travel companions a +5 to their activity check.

### Sneak
___
- **Qualities:** _none_
- **Skill Use:** Dexterity (Stealth)
- 
Stay hidden from potential dangers or pursuers.

> Only the best roll of party members who partake of this activity will be used, and not every character needs to roll as the character with the best check will assist the others.


### Track
___
- **Qualities:** _Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Survival)

Follow a specific set of tracks, or find those of others in the vicinity.

> Tracking can be used instead of Navigation when you're trying to chase another creature or group instead of going to a specific location. Instead of using the Navigation activity, make your Tracking check against the Navigation DC (plus any modifiers your quarry may have, which may include them Sneaking, as above) to follow their tracks.

## Camp Activities

### Attune Magic Item
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting_
- **Skill Use:** none

Attune to a magic item you hold on your person.

> Attuning to one magical item takes time and concentration. You do not have to identify all of the item's magical properties before you can attune to it, but doing so will subject you to all of its effects, both positive and negative.

### Camoflage Camp
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Dexterity (Stealth)

Use natural materials to hide your campsite from prying eyes.

> You can use natural materials like rocks or foliage to hide your campsite. A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check adds the Hidden property to your campsite (if it doesn't already have it).

If the campsite was not previously hidden, the DC to find your campsite is equal to the result of your Dexterity (Stealth) check. Otherwise, add 5 DC to the check to discover the campsite on a success.

### Cook Meal
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Cook's Utensils)

Cook a hearty meal to restore additional hit dice. 

A good night's rest is not guaranteed when camping in the wilds and a fine cooked meal can go a long way to remedy this fact.

> Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Cook's utensils) check. You need one fresh ration of food for every person that will partake of the meal, as well as a reasonable amount of seasoning. 

- If you succeed, each person partaking of your meal regains a quarter of their maximum hit dice (rounded down, minimum 1). 
- If you fail, the meal is edible, but not especially rejuvenating. 
- If you rolled a total of 5 or lower, the whole meal is spoiled and the rations are wasted.

You can only benefit from one cooked meal per long rest.

### Fortify Camp
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Strength (Athletics)

**Build barricades or obstacles around your camp.**

> You can use wooden spikes, rocks, or other natural cover to barricade your campsite, or even dig a ditch and a rampart around it. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check adds the Defendable property to your campsite (if it doesn't already have it).

If the campsite was not previously well-defended, the DC to enter your campsite is equal to the result of your Strength (Athletics) check. Otherwise, add 5 DC to the check to enter the campsite on a success.

### Hunt & Forage
___
- **Qualities:** _Dangerous_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Survival)

**Gather food and water, or hunt local game.**

> Make a Survival check and compare the results with the region's abundance level on the following table to determine the number of fresh rations you manage to provide. Each ration can sustain one person for one day (ie, a pound of food and a gallon of water):

| Abundance |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7   |  8   |
| :-------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  Plenty   |  10  |  12  |  14  |  16  |  18  |  20  |  22  |  24  |
|  Average  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  19  |  22  |  25  |  28  |  —   |
|  Scarce   |  15  |  19  |  23  |  27  |  31  |  35  |  —   |  —   |
|  Barren   |  20  |  25  |  30  |  35  |  40  |  —   |  —   |  —   |

This is essentially the same check as the Travel skill of the same name, but can be done after the party has stopped traveling for the day.


### Identify Magic Item
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting_
- **Skill Use:** Arcana

**Focus on a magic item you hold on your person to identify one of its properties.**

> Essentially the same ability as an adventurer can use during a short rest - focusing on a magic item in your possession during camp activities will inform you one of the item's properties on a successful Arcana roll against the item's Rarity.


### Keep Watch
___
- **Qualities:** _none_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Perception)

**Keep watch while your companions are resting.**

A long rest requires at least 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of light activity. Depending on the size of the traveling party, you are advised to take shifts keeping watch while the others try to gain some sleep.

> Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. If your result is lower than your passive Wisdom (Perception) score, you take the higher.

The DM determines the DC for any threat or other approaching danger (hostile creatures or natural phenomenons) and compares it to your Wisdom (Perception) results.

Characters performing one of the other camp activities (i.e. not sleeping and not keeping watch) only contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) score.

On a success, watchers should be extremely difficult to surprise, and very likely to be able to prepare themselves and warn the rest of the party before an encounter begins.


### Recuperate
___
- **Qualities:** _none_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Medicine)

**Take care of your wounds and catch your breath.**

You take your time to catch your breath, properly, eat and drink a little, and properly dress your wounds.

> Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DC depends on the severity of your wounds (see the Dress Wounds table).

If you succeed, treat any hit dice rolled to determine the hit points you regain as having rolled their maximum value during this rest.


### Set Traps
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Survival)

**Set up traps to slow approaching enemies.**

You can set a number of small traps like caltrops, slings, and small pits around your camp.

> Make a Wisdom (Survival) check. The DC to find these traps with an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check , as well as the DC for any saving throw made to resist their effects is equal to the result of your Wisdom (Survival) check.


### Tend Animals
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting, Focused_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Animal Handling)

**Take care of your mounts and beasts of burden.**

Long journeys can prove taxing and dangerous for animals if they are not properly cared for, fed, and secured for the night. Make sure that your mounts and other animals are properly secured, fed, and check for any signs of wounds or illnesses.

> Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check against the Navigation DC. The DC is increased by 5 if you are tending to more exotic animals.

- On a **success**, any and all healing is done at maximum capacity, and all benefits of a Long Rest apply.
- On a **failure**, healing occurs as normal, but no levels of exhaustion are cleared.

\columnbreak


### Tend Wounded
___
- **Qualities:** _Distracting_
- **Skill Use:** Wisdom (Medicine)

**Take care of your wounded companions.**

You spend your time ensuring that up to six wounds of creatures other than yourself are properly cleaned and dressed.

> Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check for each patient, in order to assess the wounds and properly dress them. The DC depends on the severity of their wounds (see the table below) and determines how many wounds the healer must dress from their allotted six.

- On a **success**, any and all hit dice rolled to restore hit points are treated as if they've rolled their maximum value.

| HP Greater Than |  DC  | Wounds to Treat |
| :-------------: | :--: | :-------------: |
|       66%       |  10  |        1        |
|       33%       |  15  |        2        |
|       0hp       |  20  |        3        |

# Sails Upon the Dread Sea

> _A collection of D&D 5e naval rules for use with the Mystara setting_


# PART I: SHIPS
Mystaran ships of the line vary widely, from the imposing, armored Ierendian Fireboats to the quick, agile sloops and pinnaces of the Guilds, but the Known World has a strong nautical tradition, and ships of nearly every kind can be found if one just knows where to look.

## Ship Properties
But before one begins to look, one should know what to look for - so the first thing we'll do is discuss the properties of ships - attributes that define their size, speed, durability, functionality, and more.

### Ability Scores

A ship has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and their corresponding modifiers. The _vast_ majority of ships do not possess mental abilities, which is why, generally speaking, they need a captain and crew - though in Mystara, everything has an exception now and then.

A ship's physical abilities are:

#### Strength (Overall Power)

The ship's combat readiness. This modifier is applied to any Wisdom (Vehicle) checks the pilot makes in order to move through obstacles, including ramming enemy ships. It also determines the damage of any Rams installed.

As a general rule, a Ram installed on a ship does as many d6 of damage as the ship's STR Modifier.

#### Dexterity (Ship Handling)

The ship’s agility and nimbleness. This modifier is applied to any Wisdom (Vehicle) checks the pilot makes in order to avoid collisions, come about, sail close to the wind, and other situations that small, swift vessels avoid more easily than large and clumsy ones.

As a general rule, so long as the ship is in motion and being actively piloted, its hull's AC _against siege engines_ (i.e., the weaponry of other ships) will additionally be modified by its DEX modifier.

#### Constitution (Seaworthiness)
The ship’s overall sturdiness. This modifier is applied to any Wisdom (Vehicle) checks the pilot makes in order to avoid foundering, sinking, and hazards that large, well-built vessels avoid more easily than small and frail ones.

As a general rule, the ship's Damage Threshhold (DT) will be equivalent to its CON score, and its hull's base AC will be its CON Modifier + 10.

### Hull AC

While ships are fairly large targets to hit, they're also heavily reinforced and often armored, and their armor classes reflect that.  A ship's base Armor Class is its CON modifier + 10 before considering ship upgrades.

### Hull HP
Ships are built with considerable strength, to endure the ravages of both sea and sea-beast. HP represent their overall resilience, though depending on how a battle flows, a ship may take on situational damage when critically hit (breaches, decks afire, etc). A ship's base hull HP is equal to 20x its CON score before considering ship upgrades.

### Rigging AC/HP
While Rigging is both less armored (AC is 10 + half its CON mod) and less sturdy (10x its CON score) than the ship's hull, it is also at Disadvantage to hit with all weapon types.

Any sail-based ship whose rigging is dropped to 50% drops one Maneuvering Class; if its rigging is destroyed, it becomes immobile.

### Damage Threshold
Ships are large structures which require a considerable attack to take damage. The damage of an attack must be greater than this number or have no effect at all on the ship or rigging. This number is not subtracted from damage, it is all or nothing. 

As noted earlier, Damage Threshold is generally equal to the raw Constitution of the ship before considering ship upgrades. Note that siege weapon attacks ignore the Damage Threshold of ships.

Like characters, ships may move up to their speed on each of their turns. The speed of a ship refers to the number of 25 ft. hexes it may move on a single turn. Smaller ships are quicker to maneuver than large ones, which is important when maneuvering around their opponents' siege engines and gaining opportunities for boarding. 


### Maneuvering Class
In addition to a maneuvering speed, a ship is also given a maneuvering class based on its DEX, as described below:

##### Maneuvering Class
|  Ship DEX   | Rating  | Speed Change | Turn Rate | Max Turn |
| :---------: | :-----: | :----------: | :-------: | :------: |
|     20+     |  Swift  |      3       |   45°/1   |   90°    |
|   14 - 19   | Nimble  |      2       |   45°/2   |   60°    |
|    8-13     | Average |      1       |   45°/3   |   45°    |
| 7 and below |  Slow   |     1/2      |   45°/4   |   30°    |

> **Speed Change**: how fast a ship can change its speed in one combat round.
> **Turn Rate**: How many hexes of straightforward movement it takes to turn the ship 45°
> **Max Turn**: Maximum turn the ship can execute in one combat round.


### Traveling Speed
While the maneuverability of smaller ships allows them to move quickly around a battlefield, they are unable to keep that speed consistently. The raw sailing power of larger ships keeps them consistent, and so are faster over long distances. Ships have a travel speed equal to the number of 8-mile hexes they are able to travel in a day (assuming 8 hours of travel). These values are what is referenced in the Pilot travel role, and are the basis for the traveling system, where a full day of travel is the full amount.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
A ship’s vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.

Ships are typically **immune** to *poison and psychic* **damage**. Ships are also usually **immune** to the following **conditions**: *blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious*.

##### Traveling Speed (8m hex)
|   Ship STR   | Cautious | Normal | Reckless |
| :----------: | :------: | :----: | :------: |
| 21 and above |    3     |   6    |    8     |
|    15-20     |    3     |   5    |    7     |
|     9-14     |    3     |   4    |    5     |
| 8 and below  |    1     |   2    |    3     |

> **Cautious**: Advantage on rolls to spot and avoid hazards or areas of interest; ship is capable of stealth in fog.
> **Normal**: Typical sailing speed, normal rolls and activities apply.
> **Reckless**: Three sheets to the wind: disadvantage on rolls to spot and avoid hazards, all crew fully committed to sailing (no other onboard activities possible).

### Cargo Capacity
Carrying Capacity of the Ship. This value does not concern cannons, crew, etc. but pertains only to items, rations, and other things being stored. Beyond this value, each ship has room for chests. All officers share access to 2 Lockboxes below deck and possess a smaller locker within their living quarters.

### Mount Points
The number of weapons the ship can mount. A light mount is suitable for a ballista. A heavy mount is suitable for a catapult or bombard.

### Upgrade Points
The number of upgrades a ship can take on (see ugprades). Some upgrades require more than one upgrade point, and others require a minimum attribute score as well.

### Complement
Crew are the sailors who work, live, and die on the ship. While this includes "Officers", the influential positions PC's are able take, it generally refers to the unskilled laborers that are hired to work the lines and cannons. Skilled crew are also a potential option, persons with proficiencies who are qualified to act as officers. 

Complement is notated in a slash format (80/10/3) - Total number of Small or Medium passengers, Minimum crew for maximum efficiency, and Skeleton crew.

## Ship Upgrades
During the construction of a new ship, or occasionally at any point after construction, the owner may choose to apply upgrades to it. The following lists contain both structural upgrades to alter the effectiveness or of the ship and themed room upgrades to provide bonuses to characters and crew.

As with the base ship, the indicated costs include materials and labor, which may vary depending on where the party chooses to get the upgrades installed. If a character wishes to participate in the construction of an upgrade, the cost reduces by a percentage equal to the character’s ability in a relevant skill, at the DM’s discretion.

### Structural Upgades
These upgrades alter the physical structure of the ship in some way. Some are purely cosmetic, though most provide
some form of mechanical benefit. Due to the complexity of some upgrades, more experienced shipwrights are required for
certain upgrades. Structural upgrades require no upgrade points - only gold.

Note that the upgrades listed here are all of fairly mundane origin. A resourceful and adventurous captain may find other ways to bolster their ship's power.

#### Armor Plating
By attaching metal plates to the ship, the hull’s damage threshold is increased by +5.

**Requirements:** Professional shipwright

**Cost:** 30% of base ship cost


#### Concealed Weapon Port
The ship’s weapon ports, if it has any, are altered to be hidden from the outside. A concealed weapon port can only
be recognised with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Requirements:** Professional shipwright

**Cost:** 100gp per port

#### Increased Cargo Capacity
By rearranging partitions and cleverly placing bulkheads, the ship’s cargo capacity is increased by 10%.

**Requirements:** Amateur shipwright

**Cost:** 15% of base ship cost

#### Ram
A ram, usually sheathed in bronze or iron, is mounted on the ship’s bow. A ship equipped with a ram deals additional collision damage based on its Strength modifier, and reduces the damage taken when ramming to 1/2 the damage inflicted.

**Requirements:** Amateur shipwright

**Cost:** 20% of base ship cost

#### Smuggling Compartments
The ship’s bulkheads are altered to provide hidden cargo storage areas. This does not change a ship’s cargo capacity. A smuggling compartment can hold anything that fits within a 5-foot cubic space. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check is required to located smuggling compartments in a search of the ship.

**Requirements:** Professional shipwright

**Cost:** 500gp per 5 foot square compartment

### Chamber Upgrades
These upgrades provide significant additional functionality to the ship while using up room which would otherwise be used for cargo or crew. Using Walrock's Fortresses, Temples, and Strongholds rules, the following Room types can be added to a ship for the following cost in Upgrade points and Carrying Capacity.

#### Alchemist's Lab
It's possible to outfit a ship with an Alchemy lab, but considerable care must be taken to ensure both the safety of the lab under extreme weather conditions, and the safety of the ship should it be exposed to alchemical substances.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 10,000gp

**Benefit:** All transmuitation spells cast within this room have twice normal duration and use half normal materials cost. Additionally, Alchemist's Supplies, Poisoner's Kit and Herbalism Kit are assumed to be present, and any checks made in this room are made at Advantage with a proficient user. Only one of these can be built per ship.

#### Animal Pen
Useful for shipping horses with your marines or livestock for trade.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 7t CC

**Cost:** 2,500gp

**Benefit:** One size Large, three size Medium, or five size Tiny animals can be safely held here in transit. Two of these can be combined to accommodate one Huge-sized animal. Multiple Animal Pens can be built per ship. The additional tonnage is to provide secure storage for feed and supplies for the animals.

#### Arcanist's Study
Just the home away from home any mage needs while sailing the seas.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 7,500gp

**Benefit:** Choose one school of magic to support - while in this room, spells in the chosen school will last twice their normal duration, cost half their usual materials cost, and roll to attack at advantage / enemies save at disadvantage. Arcana checks made here dealing with the chosen School of Magic are also made at Advantage. This room can be built multiple times to support different schools.

#### Armory
For when your seamen need to break out a can of whoop-ass.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 7t CC

**Cost:** 5,000gp

**Benefit:** If a ship with an armory comes under attack, the crew can visit the Armory and have its stats upgraded from Commoner to Guard for purposes of defense.


#### Barracks / Passenger Quarters
Whether cramped quarters for your marines or luxurious private rooms for wealthy passengers, these rooms will provide your ship with additional utility.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 2,500gp

**Benefit:** As barracks, the room can contain up to 24 crew or marines in communal bunks, or 12 passengers when configured as three individual staterooms.

#### Brig
Whether preventing mutinies or taking prisoners, the brig keeps your crew safe and your "guests" secure.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 2,500gp

**Benefit:** For each of these you build, you can safely hold up to five prisoners securely. Prisoners may only attempt to escape if they're unguarded and can gain access to a key - or by using Thieves' Tools to pick the locks (DC15 base, and an additional 500gp per extra DC).

#### Chapel
A cleric's home away from home, and a place to pray when the seas get rough.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 7,500gp

**Benefit:** A ship with a Chapel is considered _consecrated_ while a cleric of the religion is praying in it - all of the Crew is considered under the effect of both the Guidance and Bless spells while the cleric is able to maintain their prayers. Additionally, the Chapel itself is considered _Hallowed_, the specific effects of which are determined when the room is built.

#### Mess Hall
Gotta eat somewhere - may as well make it good for morale.

**Requirements:** 2 Room Points, 12t CC

**Cost:** 5,000gp

**Benefit:** Meals served within the Mess Hall by a Cook with proficiency in Cook's Utensils provide morale to the crew. Once a week, so long as there are provisions, roll 1d4 and add this to the Crew's Quality (see details under Ship's Crew).

#### Ritual Circle
The perfect place to execute the demise of your enemies, safe from prying eyes.

**Requirements:** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 7,500gp

**Benefit:** Spells which may be cast as rituals can be cast here without expending any components that don't have a gold piece cost - where such a component is required, half the usual amount can be spent. All rolls required by rituals cast within this area gain Advantage.

#### War Room
When you're looking to do more than just visit the taverns.

**Requirements;** 1 Room Point, 5t CC

**Cost:** 5,000gp

**Benefit:** Defenders of the ship gain 1d4 to their rolls To Hit. Additionally, boarding rolls and combat navigation rolls are made with Advantage.

#### Improvements
Some rooms can be modified further by the processes delineated below. Some of these can create some fabulous ships, but none of them are without significant cost to create.

##### Extradimensional Space
Guess what? That room _really isn't where you think it is_.

**Additional Cost:** 7,500gp

**Requirements:** Spellcaster with 8th Level Spells

**Benefit:** Eliminates the CC requirement from any Room, and prevents the Scrying of its occupants (they're in another Plane entirely). So long as the room's door is technically shut, the room is safe from any damage to the ship - including sinking. Of course, this can lead to other concerns...

##### Hidden
It's hard to hide an entire room on a ship, but it's not entirely impossible either.

**Additional Cost:** 2,500gp

**Benefit:** The entry to the room is not obvious. Anyone without knowledge of the room must make a DC15 Investigation check to discover the presence of the Hidden chamber, and a DC15 Sleight of Hand check to enter it.


### Exotic Upgrades

This being Dungeons and Dragons, there are plenty of ways the ship can be outfitted to perform using magical or mythic means. Some of these are enumerated below - others have yet to be discovered.

#### Hull Upgrades

##### Dragonscale Plating
Extraordinarily expensive, Dragonscale plated ships allow the ship to be Resistant to, and save at with Advantage against, the elemental effect which corresponds with the dragonscale used to plate the decks. Red dragonscale is a popular choice, as it provides protection against Fire, but others certainly have their uses.

#### Sail Upgrades

##### Mithril Sails
Possesses a DR of half the ship's. Or a higher AC. Or both.

#### Oar Upgrades

##### Razor Oars
Any ship equipped with Razor Oars and active rowers create a hazard for any other ship attempting to board it. Creatures or objects in the water to either side of the ship and within ten feet must make a DC12 Dex save or suffer 2d6 slash damage.

#### Rudder Upgrades

##### Lodestone Rudder
Provides advantage to all navigation rolls to stay on course and not get lost. Provides the ability to steer in Storm conditions or worse, rather than simply be driven by the storm, though there may be wear and tear on the sails.

##### 

### Figureheads
On rare occasions, animal spirits have been introduced into a figurehead in order to imbue a ship with special qualities. These are generally not simply bought and sold, but must be procured with the cooperation of a druid or shaman. This is not to say they're free - just that their cost is not often measured in gold. Some known examples of this practice are detailed below.

#### Dolphin
Provides the ship with one better Maneuvering Class than it would otherwise have based on its DEX score.

#### Shark
Ramming attacks are made with Advantage, and the vessel only takes a quarter of the damage it dishes out, rather than half.

#### Serpent
All boarding actions undertaken while onboard this ship gain Advantage on their rolls, including grappling. Additionally, an attempt to escape a boarding action is not undertaken at disadvantage.

#### Dragon
All siege weapons attacks originating from the ship roll damage at advantage.

#### Gull
Weather conditions which would provide Disadvantage to the crew (storms, fog, etc) are neutralized while the crew is onboard. Additionally, other ships are at Disadvantage to Hide from the crew of the ship.

#### Whale
Imbues the ship with extra traveling speed: the ship can move 1 extra hex per day in each of its Movement Categories (Cautious, Normal, and Reckless).

#### Octopus
Other ships are at Disadvantage to detect the ship in any weather other than Sunny, or when near a shoreline (or rocks larger than the ship itself)



# PART II: The Crew

## Officers
Each Ship has several Officers who share the responsibility of leadership. Player Characters or other skilled characters may take up to 2 Officer Positions each, benefiting from the features and actions of both simultaneously. Many positions are unique and may be taken by only one person at a time. Some have restrictions, requiring the ability to cast spells or certain proficiencies. The positions are:

- **Captain, First Mate, and Quartermaster**: Leadership and support
- **Helmsman**: Pilots the ship
- **Master Gunner**: The lead Cannonneer
- **Surgeon**: Recovers casualties
- **Boatswain**: Repairs to the ship or weapons
- **Leftenant**: In charge of the ship's fighting crew


All Officers share a position of authority, and as such may give orders to crew (Charisma checks if applicable). Officer Roles are not restrictions, although some may require constant attention.

During Naval Combat, ships take initiative, and every member of ship acts as one cohesive unit. Rather than taking full individual turns, Officers may only take a single action each on their ship's turn. For information on how this works, see "Officer Locations" of the Combat Section. Each Officer Position offers additional actions on top of any other actions you can normally take. These actions are Naval-Combat specific, such as firing cannons or piloting the ship.

**Features and Actions granted by officer positions are only available during Naval Combat.**

### Captain, First Mate, & Quartermaster

**Maximum**: 1 each

The Captain, First Mate, and Quartermaster are generally charismatic officers. While the names may imply authority, remember that all Officers share the top of the hierarchy of a ship. Still, a ship would be amiss without someone calling themselves “Captain” and wearing a funny hat.

Without a specific responsibility during combat, their rolls focus on supporting others and have the unique ability to plan the Boarding Action, in which the entire ship participates.

#### Available Combat Actions:
- ***Rally***: Give inspiration (d6 Inspiration Die) Chr. Check, DC dependent, once per battle.

- ***Assess***: Investigation check to locate any weakness of an opponent’s ship. If successful, you have advantage on your next attack or contest against them for the next minute.

- ***Assign Position***: As an action, you may immediately replace one Officer’s role with another, promote someone to an officer position, etc. The target must accept this change. You may also use this action to relocate a number of crew up to double your proficiency bonus to new cannon positions (For example, take 2 men off the starboard heavy cannon to have them man 2 light cannons on the port side, while having another move to man a swivel cannon.)

- ***Board***: Free Action. Give the order to Board. See Boarding for more information

#### Available Travel Actions:
- ***Stealth***: The ship’s captain can engage in this activity only if the weather conditions restrict visibility, such as in heavy fog. The ship makes a Dexterity check with a bonus equal to the crew’s quality score to determine if it can hide.
- ***Raise Morale***: The first mate can manage the crew’s time to grant extended breaks, provide instruction, and generally improve the quality of life on the ship. Once every 24 hours, if the crew’s quality score is 3 or lower, the first mate can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a successful check, the crew’s quality score increases by 1.

### Helmsman

- **Maximum**: 1
- **Recommended**: Proficiency in Water Vehicles
- **Restriction**: Cannot also be assigned Master Gunner

Manning the wheel, the Helmsman is responsible for safely navigating the vessel to its destination. While other Officers should weigh in on the direction of the ship, the Helmsman has the final say- and makes the rolls. While at the wheel, the Helmsman can take several actions to affect the battle. Whether that be taking Evasive Maneuvers to avoid the enemy’s cannons or ramming the prow directly into another ship. If you take a non-pilot action, than your pilot checks for this turn until the start of the next have disadvantage. Steering a ship is hard, doing it one-handed is harder!

#### Available Combat Actions:
- ***Evasive Maneuvers***: Dex/Str/Int Pilot Check with Disadvantage: If successful, immediately add PROF bonus to AC until the start of the ship's next turn. 1/2 Speed next turn

- ***Come About*** (Evasive Maneuver Variant): (Full Turn, Pilot check to succeed) Uses full Movement: The aft most section of ship moves to inhabit the hex forward to the one the bow was previously in, and the bow moves in a straight line over so that the ship extends perpendicular to its former orientation. ½ speed next turn. See 'Come About' in the movement section for a more detailed description.

- ***Ram***: Ram your prow into another ship using your movement. Damage noted on the ship block is damage ***per hex traveled in straight line*** that round. Half damage is taken by your ship, the other half by the ram.

- ***Pilot***: (Bonus Action): Dex/Str/Int/Wis checks to steer (disadvantage if a non-pilot action is taken during the round) Ability dependent on what needs to be done. If this bonus action is not made, ship will continue course but list to wind (assuming no other factors).

#### Available Travel Actions:
- ***Navigate***. The quartermaster can try to prevent the ship from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (See “Becoming Lost” in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more information.)


### Master Artillerist
- **Maximum**: 1
- **Restriction**: Cannot also be assigned Helmsman

Artillery requires crew to fire them, and crew require leaders to lead them. As a master artillerist, you oversee the artillery on the ship. Repairing artillery that have misfired, and giving extra guidance to your crew, you have the final decision on which of your emplacements will be fired at the enemy and the distinct honor of making the rolls. That’s a lot of dice.

#### Feature: Oversee Artillery
Select one side of the ship. You are in control of all cannons that are assigned to that side, and count as one artillerist for the sake of crewing them. Ranged proficiency is not required to be an artillerist. Effects that deal damage when you hit (Hunter’s Mark, Hex) only trigger if you are personally crewing a siege weapon - not to artillery you are overseeing.

#### Available Actions

- ***Broadside!*** (Recharge 5-6): All artillery on your side of the ship fire on a single target at disadvantage regardless of loading condition. Reroll any 1's rolled on damage dice.

- ***Fire***: Make any number of available attacks with artillery under your control.

- ***Concentrate***: Move to assist another artillerist. While there, you may help crew a siege weapon of your choice. If you possess an appropriate weapon proficiency, you may add your proficiency bonus to hit for whichever weapon you are crewing. You may return to your position as a free action.

- ***Repair***: Using Tinker's or Smiths’ tools, make a check to repair misfired artillery (DC= 8+ Misfire Score). The emplacement does not need to be one under your control. Failure results in the emplacement being inoperable. Must be proficient in the tools you use.

- ***Assess***: Investigation check to locate any weakness of an opponent’s ship. If successful, you have advantage on your next attack or contest against them for the next minute.


### Surgeon
- **Maximum**: None
- **Requirement**: Medicine Skill or other Healing Means

The Seas are a dangerous place, Doctor, and burden of life in Naval Combat lies on your shoulders. As crew are injured, you may use your action to attempt to get them on their feet again. Be sure to check out the Casualties section to better understand what your position may require. 

#### Available Actions:
- ***Treatment***: On a successful Medicine or Healing check (and one use of a Healer’s Kit where appropriate), you may return one Non-officer crew member casualty back to the fight. If your current crew count is not equal to your total, add one back (up to the original total) This action cannot be taken if you already have crew equal to your total crew. Reference Casualties for more information.

Example: During battle, 3 of your 30 crew fell (27/30 Crew). On a success, you may add 1 crew back, your new crew count being 28/30. Assuming no more casualties, you may take this action 2 more times, returning one crew member each time back to the fray.


### Boatswain
- **Maximum**: None

What a Doctor does for people, you do for boats. Only, your instruments aren’t as dainty, and boats can’t sue. Take your actions patching up holes and repairing sails- whatever you can to keep your feet dry. If you have a spare moment, fix an artillery emplacement or two. Everyone will thank you for it.

#### Available Combat Actions:
- ***Assess***: Investigation check to locate any weakness of an opponent’s ship. If successful, you have advantage on your next attack or contest against them for the next minute. You may add your proficiency modifier to this check, regardless of your proficiency in the skill.


#### Available Travel or Combat Actions:
- ***Order Repairs***: As an action, you supervise repairs. Chose to repair either the ship or the rigging. The ship recovers hit points equal to 1d4 + your level, or the rigging recovers 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. If you are proficient with carpenters’ tools, you may add your proficiency bonus to the HP gained (even if you already added it once). You may use this action 3 times per day. You may also use this action to attempt to repair a misfired artillery emplacement. Using it for the purpose does not count against the total for the day.


### Leftenant
- **Maximum**: 1
- **Restriction**: Cannot also be assigned Helmsman

While not every vessel carries marines, even the crew can and should be organized into a fighting force when the gangplanks come out and boarding actions take place. It's the Leftenant's job to provide that organization, giving orders to the marines or crew during a boarding action - or during a military action once they've arrived aground. In general, Marines and Crew have the same list of activities - Marines can additionally be given specific commands "take this hill" in organized fights, whereas Crew will act as an undisciplined force.

If a ship has no complement of marines, the Leftenant can direct the Crew's activities instead. Unlike Marines, Crew cannot be given tactical commands during a fight and will only act as an undisciplined force. They will obey the Leftenant's orders to engage in the General Melee, and will generally obey a General Retreat as well, but General Withdrawal is not available..

##### Available Actions:

- ***Repel Boarders***:
Marines focus on removing the boarding grapples of an attacking ship, gaining advantage to their attempts to remove an opponent's grappling devices.

- ***General Melee***:
Marines focus on engaging enemy targets, wherever they may be, and gain a +1 to their next attack.

- ***General Withdrawal***:
Marines focus on slowly withdrawing to their ship; enemies directly in front of them gain disadvantage when trying to attack them..

- ***General Retreat***:
Marines focus on full retreat from the battle and returning to their ship. Marines gain +5 to their speed when doing so



## Ship's Crew

A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew’s skill, experience, morale, and health are defined by its quality score. This score can affect a number of general ship activities, like the crew’s ability to notice threats or contend with hazards. 

**A crew starts with a quality score of +4**, but that score varies over time, going as low as −10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives fair leadership.

A typical crew member uses the commoner stat block in the Monster Manual.

### The Crew in Combat
Something something crew who's not Marines has lots to do in ship-to-ship combat, including assisting boarding operations, repelling boarders, repairing critical damage to the rigging and putting out fires and so on.

#### Crew's Actions
The ship's crew gets similar combat actions as a player does, and their effects are:
 - **Attack** (repels boarders)
 - **Disengage** (attempt to end a boarding encounter by dislodging/dropping grapples. Automatic success if crew's ship was the attacker)
 - **Dodge** (increases crew mobility, reducing casualties by (1d6 x 10%) this round)
 - **Help** (assist artillery, giving one emplacement advantage to its attack roll that turn)
 - **Grapple** (throw hooks to board a nearby ship)
 - **Improvise** (repair the ship or put out a fire)
 - **Ready** (be ready to respond to attack damage or a boarding action)

Crew get 3 actions per combat round at full complement, but as they take casualties they become less effective. Below 2/3 complement, they get 2 actions, and below 1/2 complement, they get 1 action. Below 1/3 complement, the ship cannot be effectively crewed, and all remaining crew engage in Improvise actions.

#### Damage & Casualties
To make it simpler to handle damage against a ship's crew, we don't worry about damaging specific crew members - but we do add their 
- All attacks against the ship do half their damage against the crew's health pool, minus their Quality score.
- All attacks against crew directly do their full damage against the crew's health pool, minus their Quality score.

### Shore Leave
Life aboard a ship is a constant wear on the crew. Spending time in port allows the crew to relax and regain its composure.

If a crew’s quality score is 3 or lower, the score increases by 1 for each day the crew spends in port or ashore.

### Mutiny
A poorly led or mistreated crew might turn against its officers. Once per day, if a crew’s quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check modified by the crew’s quality score.

If the check total is between 1 and 9, the crew’s quality score decreases by 1.

If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them, imprison them, or throw them overboard. The crew can be cowed into obedience through violence, combat, or offers of treasure or other rewards.

When the DM ends the mutiny, the crew’s quality score increases by 1d4.

***Rain/Snow***: Everything is lightly obscured; creatures have Disadvantage on Perception rolls relying on sight. In a Storm, open fire are doused and creatures making Perception rolls relying on Hearing also have Disadvantage.

***Fog***: Obscures all sight, including Darkvision, beyond 5'. Creatures effectively suffer from the Blinded condition.

***Severe Heat***: Each hour worked on deck requires a Con check at DC5 * the number of hours worked. Failed checks result in a level of Exhaustion. Armored creatures have Disadvantage on the save. Resistance to Fire grants Advantage to the roll.

***Severe Cold***: Each hour exposed to cold requires a Con check at DC5 * the number of hours exposed. Failed checks impose a level of Exhaustion. Cold weather gear or resistance to cold grants Advantage to the roll.


##### Table: Wind Strength
Once weather has been rolled, roll on this table to determine wind strength for the next span of days.
| Fair | Varies | Storm | Strength | Ranged Attacks | Siege Attacks | Sail Speed | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 01-10 |   ─    |   ─   | Becalmed  |  — | — | ×0 |
| 11-65 | 01- 20 |   ─   | Breeze    |  — | — | ×1 |

|   ─   |   ─    |  100  | Dire Gale | Impossible   | Impossible   | Driven (DC25) | 

***Ranged & Siege Engine Attacks***: Wind strength will alter the effectiveness of ranged weapons as above.

***Driven***: A driven ship can't sail or row but is instead driven directly downwind of the storm. Wisdom(Vehicle) checks must be made to keep the ship from suffering storm damage.

***Checked***: DC10 - save or treat normal ground as difficult terrain. Flying creatures are blown back 15'.

***Prone***: DC15 - save or be knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are blown back 30'.

***Blown***: DC20+ - save or be knocked prone and rolled 15', taking 1d6 damage. Flying creatures are blown back 60'. DC increases by 5 for each wind strength level.
